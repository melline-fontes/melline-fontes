### Hi, I'm Melline --- Oi, Sou a Melline.

I'm a Sr Bioinformatician currently living in US. The past few years I've been interesting is learn more about single-cell, proteomics, ATAC-seq and much more. I love to talk about metagenomics and about machine learning! Currently working in improving my english (haha) and python skills :-)
