### Hi, I'm Melline --- Oi, Sou a Melline.

I'm a Bioinformatics Specialist currently living in United States. The past few years I've been interesting is learn more about single-cell, proteomics, atac-seq etc. I love to talk about metagenomics and about machine learning! I'm in bionfo-world since 2007 and I've been using perl/awk/R is my prefered languages. Currently working in improving my python skills :-)
